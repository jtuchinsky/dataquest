    "Let's say we're data journalists, and we're working on an article about the coronavirus. Our goal is to make readers more aware of how devastating this virus is — the assumption is that we're writing the article in December 2020, when the coronavirus was still fairly new.\n",

    "We've already collected the data and added it in the top20_deathtoll.csv file (the data was collected from [Worldometer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mm3fFqriflmMDTQ39QroAot_QoPlOT0l#scrollTo=bt-WnfCy2ka0&line=6&uniqifier=1) on December 8, 2020).\n",

    "### Maximizing Data-Ink\n",
    "\n",
    "When we design graphs (and anything in general), we need design principles to guide us. Design principles help us in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They generate design options.\n",
    "* They help us choose among those options.\n",
    "\n",
    "One design principle we've already covered is **familiarity**.\n",
    ">> For example, if we need to present a frequency distribution visually, familiarity gives us a few options: a histogram and a box plot (let's assume our audience is only familiar with these two). Our audience, however, is more familiar with histograms, so we choose a histogram for our presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next design principle we're going to learn has to do with maximizing data elements on a graph. Generally, a graph has three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data elements: the numbers and the categories visually represented and the relationships between them.\n",
    "* Structural elements: the axes, the ticks, the legend, the grid, etc.\n",
    "* Decorations: extra colors, shapes, artistic drawings etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizing the data elements ensures the audience's attention is on the data — not on structure or decorations. Below, we see how removing structural elements and decorations can maximize data elements (GIF source: Darkhorse Analytics):\n",
    "\n",
    "Edward Tufte theorized the principle of maximizing data elements in his book *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information *(1983). From the total amount of ink used for printing a graph, some of the ink goes to show the data — that is the **data-ink**. As a sidenote, Tufte worked on his book in the 1980s, when most graphs were printed on paper using ink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tufte named the principle of maximizing data elements as **maximizing the data-ink ratio**. The data-ink ratio is the proportion of data-ink from the total ink:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Data-ink ratio} = \\frac{\\textbf{data-ink}}{\\textbf{total ink used to print the graph}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph with many decorations and structural parts has a low data-ink ratio. A graph where data-ink prevails has a greater data-ink ratio. Below, we see two theoretical examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Data-ink ratio}=\\frac{15}{100} = 0.15$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Data-ink ratio}=\\frac{75}{100} = 0.75$\n",
    "\n",
    "We should try to maximize the data-ink ratio within reason. Some structural elements are necessary; otherwise, the graph can become unreadable. Decorations are optional by definition, but they can help prove a point in some cases. We'll continue this discussion on the next screen, where we'll modify our graph using Tufte's principle: maximizing the data-ink ratio.\n"

    "### Final Touches\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to give it some final touches.\n",
    "First, we'll make the y-tick labels easier to read. We'll add a comma to both 150000 and 300000 to make them more readable — so people don't have to struggle to tell whether it's a 30,000 or a 300,000, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this change, we use the `Axes.set_xticklabels()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assume the rest of the code is written\n",
    "ax.set_xticklabels(['0', '150,000', '300,000'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we're going to left-align the y-tick labels (the country names) by applying a `for loop` over the `country names` using python's `zip` function. Thereafter, we will leverage the flexibility of matplotlib's `Axes.text()` method. First, however, we're going to remove the current labels using the `Axes.set_yticklabels()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assume the rest of the code is written\n",
    "ax.set_yticklabels([]) # an empty list removes the labels\n",
    "country_names = top20_deathtoll['Country_Other']\n",
    "for i, country in zip(range(20), country_names):\n",
    "    ax.text(x=-80000, y=i-0.15, s=country)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Readers who explore the graph will try to determine the approximate death toll for each country. To help them, we're going to draw a vertical line below the `150,000` value. To do that, we use the `Axes.axvline(x)` method, where `x` is the `x-coordinate` where the line begins:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assume the rest of the code is written\n",
    "ax.axvline(x=150000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The color of the vertical line is too bright and stands out more than we want. Moreover, the line spans too far vertically and isn't on the same line with the Turkey label. To fix these problems, we're going to use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ymin parameter to make it shorter — where 0 is the bottom of the plot, and 1 is the top of the plot.\n",
    "* The c parameter to change the color to 'grey'.\n",
    "* The alpha parameter to add transparency to the line.\n",

    "# Assume the rest of the code is written\n",
